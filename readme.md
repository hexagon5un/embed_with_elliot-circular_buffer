# Purpose #

The purpose of this repository is to replicate the work of Elliot from 'Embed with Elliot' in a more portable and generic format that would be useful beyond Arduino.

The original repository can be found at https://github.com/hexagon5un/embed_with_elliot-circular_buffer along with the accompanying article at https://hackaday.com/2015/10/29/embed-with-elliot-going-round-with-circular-buffers/
